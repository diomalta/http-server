# HTTP Server 🖥️

This is a wrapper do node http server, it's a simple way to create a server.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @diomalta/http-server
```

## How to use

```javascript
// Import the Application from the package
import Application from '@diomalta/http-server';

// Create a new Application instance
const app = new Application({
  bodyParsers: 'json',
  clusterMode: true,
});

// Define a GET route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Hello World');
});

// Define a users GET route
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Hello World');
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

## API

Here are the available methods you can use:

- `app.get`: Defines the GET route.
- `app.post`: Defines the POST route.
- `app.put`: Defines the PUT route.
- `app.delete`: Defines the DELETE route.
- `app.patch`: Defines the PATCH route.
- `app.use`: Use the middleware function.

## Mode

Node.js is a single-threaded platform, which means that by default, it uses only one CPU core. However, most modern systems have multiple cores. To make the most of these systems, Node.js provides a module called 'cluster' that allows the creation of child processes to handle the workload, each running on its own thread and using its own core.

### Advantages of Cluster Mode

- **Better CPU Utilization**: Cluster mode allows Node.js to utilize all available cores on the machine, leading to improved performance and responsiveness, especially for CPU-intensive applications.
- **Enhanced Performance under Heavy Load**: As demonstrated by load tests conducted with K6, cluster mode was able to handle a significantly higher number of requests per second compared to single mode. Additionally, the average response time was significantly lower in cluster mode.
- **Improved Reliability**: In cluster mode, if one of the worker processes crashes, the master process will automatically restart it. This ensures that the application is always available and reduces the risk of downtime.

### Test Results

Load tests conducted with K6 clearly demonstrate the advantages of cluster mode. In single mode, the server was able to handle around 80 requests per second, with an average response time of 6.44 seconds. However, in cluster mode, the server was able to handle over 440 requests per second, with an average response time of only 1.15 seconds. Furthermore, in cluster mode, all requests were successful, while in single mode, approximately 1.10% of requests failed.

In summary, cluster mode can offer significantly better performance and greater fault resilience compared to single mode, especially in systems with multiple CPU cores.
